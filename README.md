Hitori for the TI-NSpire calculator

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  It works on the TI-NSpire CX CAS with ndless 3.1 and should work on the TI-nspire models.  It is a puzzle game.  The goal is to mark the numbers such that there are no duplicates in any row or column.  Also you cannot have any two marked number that are adjacent to a side (diagonal is ok).  And you cannot unmarked cells from the rest of the cells.  I hope you enjoy it!

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-drop the nHitori-sdl.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 on your calculator in order to run it!

After you run it; you can add and play additional levels.  With ndless it allows start up files; and so you can add more level files to your calculator and play them!

How to play:
Navigate the menu using the arrow keys (or 2 and 8 keys) and the Enter key to start a new game.
Use the arrow keys (or 2,4,6 and 8 keys) to move the selector around the board
Use the Enter (or Ctrl) key to mark/unmark a spot.
Use the - and + keys to undo and redo your markings.
Press the tab key for the solution.
See included document as well as website to understand the rules and how to play!

Extra levels:
This program works with external level files!  There are extra level files which can be placed in any folder on the calculator.  A subfolder is a great place to put them.  When you first ran nHitori-sdl it registered the extension 'hitori' and so because the levels have the extension 'hitori' at the end it is associated with the nHitori-sdl program.  Let me know if you'd be interested in a level editor or additional levels!  The make-up of a level is very simple; you'll probably be able to figure it out.

Source:
I included my source.  I programmed with C++ which you can find out more here: http://blog.tangrs.id.au/?p=712  It uses nSDL as well as the ndless Software Development Kit.
